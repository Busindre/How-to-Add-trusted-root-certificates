# How to add trusted Root-Certificates

How-to: Adding trusted root certificates to the SO (Win / MAC / Unix).

###### Feel totally free to edit this page to add another operating systems!

##### How-to list all available ssl CA certificates in Linux.
```
# Arch , Debian, Ubuntu
awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' ' /BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

# Red-Hat, Fedora, CentOS
awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' ' /BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

# Centos 5
awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' ' /BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

## Mac OS X

Double click on the certificate is usually enough. It can be done from the console too.

### Add
```
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/new-root-certificate.crt
```
### Remove
```
sudo security delete-certificate -c "<name of existing certificate>"
```

---

## Windows

### Add
```
certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" new-root-certificate.crt
```

### Remove
```
certutil -delstore "ROOT" serial-number-hex
```

---

## Ubuntu, Debian, Arch

### Add (Option 1)
Copy your CA to dir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
```
sudo cp foo.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/foo.crt
```
Update the CA store:
```
sudo update-ca-certificates
```
### Add (Option 2)
Copy your CA to dir /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
```
cp foo.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
# Alternatice Dir: /usr/share/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
```
Update the CA store:
```
update-ca-trust
```

### Remove

Remove your CA (/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/)
```
sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh
```

---

## Suse 

### Add
Copy your CA to dir /etc/pki/trust/anchors/
```
sudo cp foo.crt /etc/pki/trust/anchors/foo.crt
```
Update the CA store:
```
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

---

## CentOs > 6.X

### Add
Install the ca-certificates package:
```
yum install ca-certificates
```
Enable the dynamic CA configuration feature:
```
update-ca-trust force-enable
```
Add it as a new file to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/:
```
cp foo.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
update-ca-trust extract
```

---

## CentOs < 5.X

### Add
Append your trusted certificate to file /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```
cat foo.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

---

## Solaris

Solaris-specific Solaris keeps the CA certs in "/etc/certs/CA/".
Hashed links to the CA certs are in "/etc/openssl/certs/" for fast lookup and access (usually by OpenSSL). 

By convention, but not required, the filenames in "/etc/certs/CA" is the cert holder's CN with spaces replaced by underscores ("_") and appended with a .pem file name extension. For example, file "/etc/certs/CA/foo.pem" contains the cert for CN "VeriSign Class 4 Public Primary Certification Authority - G3".

### Add

Make or verify the cert is world-readable, if not already.
```
chmod a+r foo.pem; ls -l foo.pem
```

Copy the cert to directory "/etc/certs/CA".
```
cp -p foo.pem /etc/certs/CA/
```

Install he cert into "/etc/certs/ca-certificates.crt" and add a hashed link in "/etc/openssl/certs/".
```
/usr/sbin/svcadm restart /system/ca-certificates
```

### Verify

Verify the CA cert service has restarted (and processed your new CA cert).
```
/usr/sbin/svcs /system/ca-certificates
```
If the service hasn't started it could be the cert is corrupt or is a duplicate of an existing CA cert. Look for error messages in files "/var/svc/log/system-ca-certificates:default.log" and "/system/volatile/system-ca-certificates:default.log"

## Firefox Browser
Firefox has its own certificate store.
```
Firefox Options -> Advanced -> Certificates
```

---

## JVM / Java Keystore
Java uses the popular "Java KeyStore (JKS)", it does not use the trusted-root-certificates of the operating system.
```
keytool -import -alias CERT_ALIAS_NAME -keystore /usr/java/jdkXXXX/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file foo.crt
```
